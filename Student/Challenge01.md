# Challenge 1 - Migration

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge02.md)

## Introduction

Your fledgling company has two migration tasks at hand. In both cases, your clients would like to migrate their SQL Server instances into Azure. Each solution has different requirements. 

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to migrate AdventureWorks and WWI Databases (OLTP and OLAP) to Azure SQL database. Each presents a unique set of customer requirements; be sure to read the optional advanced challenges -- while completing the advanced challenges is not required for this challenge, it may impact your implementation choices.

### AdventureWorks 

AdventureWorks has provided the following requirements and guidelines:

1. Database must be able to scale rapidly and easily for seasonal demand.
1. Requires database backups to be maintained for 1 year, with weekly granularity.
1. Database can be migrated offline during one of the nightly maintenance windows.
1. If there are any migration blockers/remediation steps, document them with any suggested fixes.
    1. These fixes do not need to be implemented, but should be called out.

### Wide World Importers

Wide World Importers has provided the following requirements and guidelines:

1. Both WWI OLTP and data warehouse databases are to be migrated; they do not need to be on the same server.
1. Database migration for the OLTP database must be done online with minimum downtime.
    1. For the purposes of this challenge, use the WWI Order Insert Solution (Windows Application) to simulate load on the on-premises database during migration/assessment.
1. Database migration for the data warehouse can be done offline.
1. SSIS package as part of the WWI DW ETL is a *bonus challenge* and not required.

## Success Criteria

* Ensure AdventureWorks database is migrated, noting any blockers with suggestions for remediation.
* Complete a database assessment of the Wide World Importers OLTP database.
* Complete online migration of the Wide World Importers database.

## Tips

* Learn about the [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/database-migration/) and leverage the [Azure Database Migration Guide.](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/)
* Read up on [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595) including [this overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-ver15) for more information.
* Read more on getting started with [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15), and refer to this [Azure Data Studio Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) for more information.
* Any assessment tool may be used to perform an assessment; DMA (Data Migration Assistant) includes assessment and SKU recommendation tools.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

* WWI is interested in understanding the performance impact of zone redundant availability.
    * Use [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store?view=sql-server-ver15), [Database Experimentation Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/dea/database-experimentation-assistant-overview?view=sql-server-ver15), or other similar analytics to provide data to back up your analysis; workloads may be simulated using the WWI Order Insert Solution referenced below.
